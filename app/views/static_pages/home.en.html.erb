        How did it start?</h1>
        <p class="history-text">
          In 2000, Siomara Sierra joins as an ideal partner to maximize a company dream of two friends, including her sister Lilana Sierra who was an unconditional support for the flowering and permanence of the company in its beginnings. The initial idea about the duo emerges from the designing of women’s clothing produced by subcontractors and sold in a personalized way all over the country; however their business idea was conceived as a distant future.
        </p> 
        <p class="history-text">
          Although the idea worked as a small scale, and was able to stay in the market, the view that Siomara Sierra had about the business was stronger, and was sensed as a reality.  
        </p>
        <p class="history-text">
          <div class="phrase">
            <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i><i> A clear and powerful idea soon becomes a reality </i><i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>.
          </div>
          The hazards of life do not wait and when someone has the conviction of something they never give up until they accomplish it. With the same confidence Siomara Sierra rose up from several difficult situations to continue with her own project, where she worked step by step with effort and courage and she has been very successful.

          <p class="history-text">
            This is how the brand Siomara Sierra has been extended and consolidated for thirteen years at national level. As a renowned company in the women’s fashion industry, where designs are transformed into a quality product, style and affordability, the clothing is always designed to accompany women in each of her life stages.
          </p>
          <p class="history-text">
            A working structure, with the adequate machinery and qualified personnel to perform the manufacturing and a committed lead team, they are a part of the evaluation process of the garment, which gives strong value added and warranty when trading. The brand Siomara Sierra is stepping up to the challenge of launching into new markets in a national and international level meeting all the demands imposed by the society, and it qualifies to continue growing, adding to the benefits of always being different and original.
